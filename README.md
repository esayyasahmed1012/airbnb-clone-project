## Database Design

The database for the Airbnb clone project is structured around the following key entities, with their important fields and relationships described below:

### Entities

#### 1. Users
- **id**: Unique identifier for each user (e.g., UUID or integer).
- **name**: Full name of the user.
- **email**: User's email address for login and notifications.
- **password_hash**: Securely hashed password for authentication.
- **role**: User type (e.g., guest, host, or admin).

#### 2. Properties
- **id**: Unique identifier for each property.
- **host_id**: Foreign key linking to the User who owns the property.
- **title**: Name or title of the property (e.g., "Cozy Beach Cottage").
- **description**: Detailed description of the property.
- **price_per_night**: Cost per night in local currency.

#### 3. Bookings
- **id**: Unique identifier for each booking.
- **property_id**: Foreign key linking to the booked Property.
- **user_id**: Foreign key linking to the User making the booking.
- **check_in_date**: Start date of the booking.
- **check_out_date**: End date of the booking.

#### 4. Reviews
- **id**: Unique identifier for each review.
- **property_id**: Foreign key linking to the reviewed Property.
- **user_id**: Foreign key linking to the User who wrote the review.
- **rating**: Numerical rating (e.g., 1-5 stars).
- **comment**: Text content of the review.

#### 5. Payments
- **id**: Unique identifier for each payment.
- **booking_id**: Foreign key linking to the associated Booking.
- **amount**: Total payment amount.
- **payment_status**: Status of the payment (e.g., pending, completed, failed).
- **payment_date**: Date and time of the payment.

### Relationships
- **Users ‚Üî Properties**: One-to-Many. A User (host) can own multiple Properties, but each Property belongs to one User (via `host_id`).
- **Properties ‚Üî Bookings**: One-to-Many. A Property can have multiple Bookings, but each Booking belongs to one Property (via `property_id`).
- **Users ‚Üî Bookings**: One-to-Many. A User (guest) can make multiple Bookings, but each Booking is made by one User (via `user_id`).
- **Properties ‚Üî Reviews**: One-to-Many. A Property can have multiple Reviews, but each Review is linked to one Property (via `property_id`).
- **Users ‚Üî Reviews**: One-to-Many. A User can write multiple Reviews, but each Review is written by one User (via `user_id`).
- **Bookings ‚Üî Payments**: One-to-One. Each Booking has one Payment, and each Payment is linked to one Booking (via `booking_id`).
## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb clone project includes the following main features to deliver a comprehensive platform for property rentals, user interactions, and transactions:

### 1. User Management
Enables users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely. This feature supports role-based access (e.g., guest, host, admin) and ensures personalized user experiences.

### 2. Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with details like title, description, and price. It provides users with a robust interface to browse and explore available properties.

### 3. Booking System
Facilitates users in reserving properties by specifying check-in and check-out dates. This system ensures seamless booking management and availability tracking for properties.

### 4. Payment Processing
Handles secure payment transactions for bookings, recording details like amount and status. It integrates with payment gateways to ensure reliable and efficient processing.

### 5. Review System
Permits users to post ratings and comments for properties they‚Äôve stayed at. This feature enhances trust and transparency by showcasing user feedback.

### 6. API Documentation
Provides detailed documentation using OpenAPI standards and supports RESTful APIs and GraphQL queries. It ensures developers can easily integrate and interact with the backend.

### 7. Database Optimizations
Implements indexing and caching strategies to enhance data retrieval speed and reduce database load. This improves overall performance and scalability of the platform.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect user data, ensure safe transactions, and maintain platform integrity. The following key security measures will be implemented to safeguard the Airbnb clone project:

### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication
- **Implementation**: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with Django REST Framework to verify user identity for API requests. Refresh tokens will ensure secure session management.
- **Purpose**: Ensures only registered users access protected endpoints (e.g., `/users/`, `/bookings/`), preventing unauthorized access.

#### 2. Authorization
- **Implementation**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin). For example, only hosts can create properties via `/properties/`.
- **Purpose**: Prevents users from performing actions beyond their privileges, such as deleting another user‚Äôs property or accessing admin data.

#### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: Apply rate limiting using Django middleware or Redis to cap API requests per user (e.g., 100 requests/hour).
- **Purpose**: Mitigates abuse, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, ensuring fair resource usage and system availability.

#### 4. Data Encryption
- **Implementation**: Use HTTPS for all API communications and encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details) in transit and at rest with AES-256.
- **Purpose**: Protects user and payment data from interception or breaches, maintaining confidentiality.

#### 5. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Implementation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs on API endpoints to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Purpose**: Ensures data integrity and prevents malicious code from compromising the system.

### Importance of Security for Key Project Areas

- **User Management**: Authentication and authorization protect user profiles and credentials, preventing identity theft and unauthorized profile modifications.
- **Property Management**: Authorization ensures only verified hosts manage their listings, maintaining trust in property data accuracy.
- **Booking System**: Rate limiting and input validation prevent fraudulent bookings or system overload, ensuring reliable reservations.
- **Payment Processing**: Data encryption and secure authentication safeguard financial transactions, reducing the risk of fraud or data leaks.
- **Review System**: Input sanitization prevents malicious content in reviews, preserving platform credibility and user trust.
